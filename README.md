# The-Doors---CIS505

TO-DO
- message class for parsing and returning message type
- handle when a participant leaves
- handle when a participant tries to join the chat room but there is no chatroom active
- handle the case when a participant tries to join the chatroom by communicating with another participant instead of the sequencer.
  - this will probably use message class to return the parsed members.
- multi threading to handle heart beat messages and data messages concurrently.
